#### Investigating internet speeds related to location, idea could be as a "travel tool": https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/ookla-internet-speed-dataset
pros: 
- Easy to work with the data
- Data is global; can specify a focus area for specific angles of inquiry
- It's cool data and many types of analysis can be done
- People have engaged with it before, it has a lot of downloads

cons:
- It is quite big, 15 GB
- The data collection method and limitations pertaining to this is not well documented
- Might be hard to know the cause of biases in the data

#### Fortnite; Analyzing where players drop on the map and how they rotate around the map as the circle closes. Are there any winning strategies for drop and rotation and where does fighting concentrate? 
pros:
- Controlled environment
- Fun to analyze
