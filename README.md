# GeospatialCourseProject
Contains our exam project for the Geospatial Data Science course.
Our project idea: Where should we invite the forest in Denmark? 

## Datasets
### Soil_types dataset
https://dataverse.geus.dk/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.22008/FK2/AAEEMN
### forest areas etc. dataset (OSM data) 
https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/denmark.html
### Regions, kommuner, sogne
https://dataforsyningen.dk/data/992

### Dataset generation
All code can be executed with the datasets detailed above, but do note that generating some of the self-defined datasets in the code can be very computationally expensive, in in total this process can take > 10 to 15 hours depending on hardware. 

### Code
Two notebooks are available, OSM_notebook and OSM_notebook_autocorr. The first is mostly about soil quality, and land use. The second is about current forestation trends and plotting of new proposed forest areas.
